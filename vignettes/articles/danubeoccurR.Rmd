# Introduction

the `danubeoccurR` package is designed to facilitate the management, cleaning, 
and analysis of fish species occurrence data in the Danube River Basin. With its
easy-to-use functions and integration with data sources such as the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), `danubeoccurR` allows researchers,
conservationists, and policymakers to efficiently handle species occurrence data
, visualize species distributions, and conduct analyses of aquatic biodiversity 
in this critical European river system.

## Key Features

### Data Management
- Import and clean fish species occurrence records from a variety of sources,
including GBIF and partner databases.

### Mapping
- Visualize species occurrences on interactive maps, with customizable layouts
and options for analyzing geographic patterns of biodiversity.

### Metadata Handling
- Automatically generate and manage metadata files for documentation of data
sources, methods, and other essential information.

### Data Cleaning
- Use built-in functions to detect and correct errors in the data, such as
inconsistent georeferencing or missing information.

### Conservation Insights
- Leverage the power of clean, high-quality data to inform conservation
strategies, habitat suitability models, and biodiversity assessments for the
Danube River Basin.

## Why `danubeoccurR`?

The Danube River is one of Europe's longest and most important rivers, home to
a rich diversity of aquatic species. However, ongoing environmental threats such
as pollution, habitat loss, and climate change are impacting the biodiversity of
the river system. The ability to clean, manage, and analyze occurrence data is
crucial for monitoring these changes and developing effective conservation
strategies.

The `danubeoccurR` package is tailored to meet the specific needs of researchers
and practitioners working in the Danube River Basin, offering robust tools to
manage the large volumes of biodiversity data collected from this region.
Whether you are a researcher analyzing species distributions, a conservationist
developing habitat suitability models, or a policymaker seeking data to inform
decisions, `danubeoccurR` provides the tools you need to streamline your workflow.

## Getting Started

To begin using the `danubeoccurR` package, install it from CRAN or GitHub and
start importing and managing your occurrence data. The package comes with 
detailed documentation, including vignettes, examples, and function references
to help you get the most out of its features.

### Installation

```r
# Install from CRAN (when available)
install.packages("danubeoccurR")
