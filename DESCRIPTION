Description: This R package provides a set of tools to download, clean, and
    standardize species occurrence records, with a focus on fish species in the     
    Danube River Basin. While primarily designed for Danube fish data,
    the package can be applied to species occurrence data more broadly. It 
    includes functions for both experienced R users and those with less coding
    experience, offering user-friendly interfaces and interactive features via
    Shiny apps, making it accessible to a wider audience.
